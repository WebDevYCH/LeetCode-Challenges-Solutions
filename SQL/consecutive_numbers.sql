     Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

               +----+-----+
               | Id | Num |
               +----+-----+
               | 1  |  1  |
               | 2  |  1  |
               | 3  |  1  |
               | 4  |  2  |
               | 5  |  1  |
               | 6  |  2  |
               | 7  |  2  |
               +----+-----+
     For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
